/*
Extend the Account class by creating a class called SavingsAccount in a file called savingsaccount.js. 
In addition to the attributes of Account, SavingsAccount should have an interest variable, 
which is set in the constructor and has a getter and a setter mehtod. 
It should also have an addInterest() method which deposits the interest amount into the account. 
The calculation for the amount is balance * interest / 100 . 
Be sure to also overwrite the toString() method, and create Mocha / Chai 
tests for the methods in SavingsAccount. 
You do not have to test the methods that SavingsAccount receives from Account, 
since theyâ€™ve already been tested in Account.
